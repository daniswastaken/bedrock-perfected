## Introduction

**Bedrock Perfected** is a Minecraft Bedrock add-on that aims to make the game better in many ways — from tweaked crafting recipes and improved textures to extra mechanics like damage indicators.

This add-on packs **a lot** of features. So many, in fact, that listing everything here would just turn into a wall of text. The best way to understand it is honestly to try it yourself.

There are so many features in this add-on that the usual marketplace-style description becomes almost impossible to do properly.
Instead, all features are fully documented on the **wiki**, where everything is organized, explained, and kept up to date.
